Welcome to the Data Science for Pavement Symposium pre-symposium workshop! This repository contains the lab materials for this 8 hour workshop covering the fundamentals of using Python for data science and data visualizaiton in the context of assessing pavement conditions and developing predictive models. The labs herin have been designed assuming little to no previous experience with python, but progress quickly. If you would like additional resources for practice learning the Python fundamentals we recommend you use the [turorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) provided by W3 Schools.

This workshop will introduce the foundational packages of the python data science stack, including `pandas`,  `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Objectives
By the end of this workshop you will be able to:
- Read and write well documented python code for data analysis.
- Identify and respond to errors when coding.
- Develop effective static data visualizaitons that effectively communicate insights.
- Describe the distinctions between machine learning algorithms and approaches.
- Train simple machine learning learning models.
- Accurately analyze, assess and describe the outputs of machine learning models.
