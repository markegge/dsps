    "You've seen a few examples of very simple plots created using pandas built in functions, but there is a wide variety of options when plotting in python. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is one of the most common and comprehensive plotting libraries used for static data visualizaiton, it allows for a great deal of fine control over the details of plotting, and it works well with other libraries such as Pandas and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Matplotlib is actually the base code used for the plotting operations of both Pandas and Seaborn. Pandas and Seaborn simplify certain elements of matplotlib, but matplotlib is useful when we seek fine tuned control. \n",
