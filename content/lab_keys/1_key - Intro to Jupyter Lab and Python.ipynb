Markdown is a simple coding language that allows for flexible styling of written content. "

In python the two primary tools we have to do this are functions and loops. These can be complicated subjects to learn in depth but we can start simple!

We can define one like this:"

A \"for\" loop is often used in data analysis to perform some action for every item in some domain, such as a list! Let's create a loop that, for each item in `my_list` adds some value to it using our `add()` function from earlier."
